# make-index

Given a folder structure:

```
 src
   - components
     - AComponent
       - index.js
     - AnotherComponent
       - index.js
```

This utility creates a file at `src/components` with the contents:

```
// DO NOT EDIT - this file was generated by [make-index](https://github.com/penx/make-index)
export AComponent from './AComponent';
export AnotherComponent from './AnotherComponent';
```

This is an initial implementation with hard coded settings - the intention is to extend this to make the following configurable:

 - template for each line using sprintf
 - glob path for finding files
 - root directory
 - output filename

PRs for the above welcome.
